       <p> In my perspective, I think the role of web authors is that they should make everything easy and to the point. 
        When I am in a website or application, I should not be clicking or pressing on multiple links just so I could find what I 
        need to find. In a buisness point of view, society today likes things that are fast and makes life easy. So whichever
        company makes life fast and easy society will easily pick that choice. Web authoring should always be up to date on
        people's needs. Web authors should make it so that everyone has accessibility. This includes people with disabilities.
        With more and more people accessing the web from a variety of devices, it is important for websites to be designed in a way 
        that is responsive to different screen sizes. This means that web authors should focus on creating websites that can adapt to 
        different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience no matter where the site is accessed from.
        In conclusion, the future of web authoring should be focused on accessibility, responsive design, dynamic content, web standards, 
        and user experience. As technology continues to evolve, web authors must adapt and innovate to keep pace with changing demands and 
        user needs. By focusing on these key areas, web authors can create websites that are both functional and enjoyable to use, and that 
        provide a valuable resource to all users.
